## Project: AI-powered Waste Management System

### Inspiration
Imagine a future where waste is not a problem, but an opportunity. A future where we can turn our daily waste into valuable resources, reducing pollution and preserving our planet for generations to come. Our team is motivated by the urgency to find sustainable solutions to tackle the waste management crisis, and technology serves as the key to solving this vital problem.

### The Problem
Every day, the world generates over 2 billion tons of municipal solid waste annually, and estimates suggest that the global economic cost of mismanaged waste could reach $375 billion per year by 2025. Global recycling rates for municipal solid waste are estimated to be around only 13.5%, signifying the need for proper classification and sorting of these waste types for effective recycling and resource recovery.

### Our Solution
We aim to develop an intelligent waste classification system that can accurately identify different waste categories, such as cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash, using advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques.

### Key Features
1. **Automated Sorting Process:**
   - Utilized InceptioNetV3 Machine learning model for image classification to sort different categories of waste (plastic, metal, glass, paper, and cardboard).
   - Once the waste material is identified by the model, it is automatically sorted into the appropriate category or bin, where for instance, blue dustbin would be used for recyclable material such as paper.
   
2. **Real-Time Video Processing:**
   - In addition to image classification, our AI system is capable of performing real-time video processing, enabling seamless integration into existing waste management workflows.
   - By leveraging the computational power of hardware and optimized algorithms, our model can process videos in real-time, detecting and classifying waste materials as they appear.
   
3. **Waste Disposal Guidance:**
   - When a user submits an image or video, our system not only predicts the waste category but also offers specific guidance on the appropriate disposal method and the corresponding bin or container for that particular type of waste.
   - This feature provides users with the knowledge necessary to contribute to effective waste segregation and recycling efforts, promoting environmental responsibility and sustainable practices.

### Development Process
Our team followed a systematic approach to build this AI-powered waste classification system. We collected an extensive dataset of waste images across various categories and preprocessed it for model training. We employed transfer learning techniques, leveraging the InceptionV3 model architecture. After fine-tuning and optimizing the model, we integrated it into a user-friendly web application using the Streamlit framework.

### Challenges
- **Ambiguous Object Identification:** Addressing instances where the system misidentifies certain materials, such as confusing plastic with glass.
- **Image Capturing through Camera Issues:** Overcoming challenges in capturing objects through the userâ€™s camera and classifying the waste category.
- **Computational Expense in Training:** Dealing with the computational intensity and time-consuming nature of the training process.

### Accomplishments
- **Deep Learning Model with Exceptional Accuracy:** Developed a model with accuracy rates of 95.39% on training data and 89.37% on test data.
- **Video Processing Integration:** Successfully incorporated video processing technology to identify and segregate waste materials efficiently.
- **User-Centric Interface:** Designed a simple interface using Streamlit for our website, focusing on ease of use and providing waste disposal information.
- **Model Integration with Streamlit:** Integrated our machine learning model with Streamlit to develop a user-friendly web application.

By addressing challenges and leveraging our accomplishments, we aim to revolutionize waste management and contribute to a cleaner, greener future.
